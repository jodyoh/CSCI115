    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <p><em>Dough:</em></p>
    <p>Combine milk and water in glass measuring cup. Microwave on high until mixture is warmed to 120&deg;F, (45 to 60
        seconds). Dissolve granulated sugar and salt in the warm liquid; stir in and dissolve the yeast. Allow to sit
        for 10 miute to "proof"; if mixture is frothy when you come back, you can continue on to next steps, (if it is
        not frothy, the dough will not rise - dump it and start again).</p>
    <p>Pre-heat your oven to 375&deg;F.</p>
    <p>Add ingredients into your mixing bowl in this order; approximately 2&frac12; cups of the flour, egg, and softened
        butter. Start mixing, and as this is mixing, pour in the yeast mixture. Continue to mix until flour is absorbed
        and dough is ticky, scraping down sides of the bowl periodically. If dough is very sticky, add more of the flour
        by the tablespoonful until dough begins to form a all and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn dogh out
        onto lightly floured work surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, adding more flour if sticky, about five
        minutes. Form into a ball.</p>

    <p><em>Filling:</em></p>
    <p>You can allow the dough to rest for ten minutes and in the meantime, using a medium-sized bowl, mix together
        brown sugar, cinnamon, and softened butter. Also, line a 10' x 13' baking pan with parchment paper.</p>
    <p>Roll out dough into a 12' x 9' rectangle. Spread dough with the cinnamon/brown sugar leaving a &frac12;' border.
        (Sprinkle on raisins, if you have chosen to add them.) Starting along a long side of the rectangle, roll dough
        into a log, pinching gently to keep it rolled up. With seam-side down, cut dough crosswise with a thing sharp
        knife (or un-flavored, waxed, dental-floss. Sliding it under the log and then corssing the ends over top of the
        log and pulling tight - cutting like this doesn't squish the log like a knife does.), into twelve equal slices,
        which you will place into your lined baking dish.</p>
    <p><strong>Optional</strong> - You can cover the baking dish with plastic wrap, then a kitchen towel and allow to
        rise in a
        warm, draft-free area until almost doubled in volume, 30 minutes. But you can also just pop them right into the
        oven without the additional rise.</p>
    <p>Position rack in centre of oven and bake until tops are golen, about 25 minutes. Allow to cool before frosting.
    </p>

    <p><em>Icing:</em></p>
    <p>Beat the cream cheese and butter until it is creamy. Add vanilla. Add icing sugar &frac14; cup at a time until
        all has been added and frosing is smooth. Layer icing on top of cooled cinnamon buns and enjoy!</p>
